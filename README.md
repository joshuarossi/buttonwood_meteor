Project Buttonwood

This will be a web app, it will allow people to advertise the price at which they wish to sell or buy bitcoins, as well as allowing them to easily and quickly update that advertisement to reflect rapidly changing market conditions.

The design of this project will be as follows:

We will be using the meteor backend for a real-time, reactive, synchonized user experience. Please look at the milestones, if you are looking to get involved.
